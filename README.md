# Awesome Inc Basic Repo Template

Use this repo as a starter template

Add your pseudocode to the [pseudocode.md file](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/basic-repo/blob/master/pseudocode.md)

This repo contains:

```raw
.gitignore - This file ignores specific files that are unnecessary to upload to GitHub, such as .DS_Store files
README.md - This is your readme file, useful information to the user always goes here, such as what is in this file. Be sure to add specific details regarding your own project here so anyone who looks at your repo can understand what is being stored inside or how to run the code.
pseudocode.md - This is where your pseudocode will go. Eventually you can put your tasks in a GitHub Project Kanban Board as individual stories. 
```
